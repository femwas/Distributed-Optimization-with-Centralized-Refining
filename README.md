## Abstract of the DO-CR
Distributed-Optimization with Centralized-Refining (DO-CR) mechanism to achieve more efficient resource allocation by engaging both access point and all devices. 
Specifically, the new DO-CR mechanism first utilizes the distributed processing capacity of all devices, allowing them to optimize their own resource allocation schemes through a new resource reservation and reporting technique. 
Then a centralized optimizer generates a graph of resource trading topology based on individual optimization results and achieves the Pareto optimal solution by the graph-based algorithm. This Pareto optimal solution simplifies the overall optimization problem and enables the central optimizer to solve it with smaller feasible regions.
