Distributed-Optimization with Centralized-Refining (DO-CR) mechanism to achieve more efficient resource allocation by engaging both access point and all devices. 
Specifically, the new DO-CR mechanism first utilizes the distributed processing capacity of all devices, allowing them to optimize their own resource allocation schemes through a new resource reservation and reporting technique. 
Then a centralized optimizer generates a graph of resource trading topology based on individual optimization results and achieves the Pareto optimal solution by the graph-based algorithm. This Pareto optimal solution simplifies the overall optimization problem and enables the central optimizer to solve it with smaller feasible regions.

The two excel files includes Packet Error Rate (PER) and Throughput performance under different levels of MCS and channel conditions. Please find more details of channel simulation in our paper below.
